    #     * Beachfront: Clean, groomed golden sand with public volleyball nets and designated "safe swimming" zones marked by stylish buoys.

    #     **Business & Dining:**
    #     * Architecture: A row of 3-4 "Tropical Contemporary" beachfront pavilions. Use glass, light wood, and white steel.

    #     * Resilience: Subtle sea-wall integration disguised as seating and a smart drainage system to handle coastal flooding.

    #     **Visual Style:**
    #     * Cinematic architectural visualization, 8k resolution, realistic textures of sand and sea foam, ray-traced water reflections.

    # Generate a photorealistic 3D render of a future urban development at Coco Beach, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The image should be captured with a cinematic drone perspective, similar to a 50mm lens shot with a shallow depth of field to emphasize the main development area.

    # **Environment Details:**
    # *   **Location:** Coco Beach, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (referencing the attached images for geography and water color).
    # *   **Climate:** Bright, sunny tropical day during golden hour, with soft, natural lighting, warm reflections in the water, and gentle shadows.
    # *   **Terrain:** Pristine golden-white sand beach transitioning smoothly to crystal-clear turquoise water.
    # *   **Vegetation:** Lush tropical greenery, palm trees lining the shore, and native Tanzanian flora integrated into the design.

    # **Urban Planning/Design Focus:**
    # *   **Architecture:** Modern, sustainable tropical architecture (low-rise apartment collection/resort complex). Buildings should feature light, natural materials, green rooftops, and elevated foundations to mitigate flood risk (as mentioned in our previous data profile).
    # *   **Infrastructure:** Integrate subtle, modern urban planning elements: a well-designed, paved boardwalk/promenade along the coast, subtle wave breaks for coastal protection, and dedicated pedestrian paths connecting the complex. The design must respect the natural coastline as much as possible.
    # *   **Atmosphere:** The scene should be vibrant and active, including a few realistic human figures enjoying the beach (swimming, sunbathing) and walking along the new promenade.

    # **Quality Directives:**
    # *   **Style:** Hyper-realistic, professional architectural visualization.
    # *   **Resolution:** Ultra-high resolution, cinematic quality.
    # *   **Lighting:** Emphasize vivid colors, highly detailed textures of the sand, water, materials, and foliage. Ensure excellent dynamic range.

    # *Use the provided images as the primary visual guide for location, atmosphere, and geography.* """
